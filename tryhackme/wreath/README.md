### About the Network

* There are three machines on the network
* There is at least one public facing webserver
* There is a self-hosted git server somewhere on the network
* The git server is internal, so Thomas may have pushed sensitive information into it
* There is a PC running on the network that has antivirus installed, meaning we can hazard a guess that this is likely to be Windows
* By the sounds of it this is likely to be the server variant of Windows, which might work in our favour
* The (assumed) Windows PC cannot be accessed directly from the webserver\
